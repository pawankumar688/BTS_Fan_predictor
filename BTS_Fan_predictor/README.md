#BTS FAN Predinctor:

Bangtan Boys every one know about BTS, if not atlest you heard about it once in while, but if you really didn't heard at all then ask you 16 year old to 18 year old sister, firend, or someone you know if they use social media a lot they will explain you every each thing about BTS, about there group members, about there hits songs, about there relationship, and even about there blood type, you don't bleave me right, I'm talking with my expericen, I let you know I comes from a very small city of pakistan which might be 1/12 of the Newyork city. So and my model is about to predict if girl or women is fan or likes the BTS or not, I created my own datasets about this topic which have 100 number of rows which, I created in one hour, I will unpdate it in future for batter prediction for the model, so think of this model as a prototype.
